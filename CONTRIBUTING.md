## How should i do it?

It's really simple, you just need to know a little bit of markdown 😎

👉 Find a nice name to your prank
👉 Create a markdown file with the name of the idea as the name of the file using `-` as the separator, explaining the idea and how to do it
👉 Link your prank in the README.MD file with `[<the idea name>](<the-idea-name.md>)`

And that's it 🎉
